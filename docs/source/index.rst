Motivation
--------

Hello and welcome to my OFDM Receiver project page! 

My name is Ali Karbassi. I am a working professional in the commerical industry working as a RF Engineer since 2013. I specialize in RF Test and Verification.

I gradauted in 2021 with a degree in Wireless Embedded Systems from UC San Diego to expand my knowledge of Wireless Communcation technology. Although I gained a lot of knowledge, I have not been able to apply the skills I acquired from the program since graduating. So I have decided to come up with a personal project to refress and reinforce my wireless communicaiton and embedded systems knowledge that I gained in school.
