Motivation
--------

Hello and welcome to my OFDM Receiver project page! 

My name is Ali Karbassi. I am a working professional in the commerical industry working as a RF Engineer since 2013. I specialize in RF Test and Verification.

I gradauted in 2021 with a degree in Wireless Embedded Systems from UC San Diego to expand my knowledge of Wireless Communcation technology. Although I gained a lot of knowledge, I have not been able to apply the skills I acquired from the program since graduating. So I have decided to come up with a personal project to refress and reinforce my wireless communicaiton and embedded systems knowledge that I gained in school.

**DISCLAIMER** I do not claim and am not an expert in this area which means there could be mistakes in the content of this page. I encourage indivduals to do their own research outside of this page.

I'm always open to feedback, getting others perspectives, and learning more so feel free to reach out to me at 'sdr.ali.karbassi@gmail.com <sdr.ali.karbassi@gmail.com>/_ with questions/comments.
