Motivation
--------

Hello, my name is Ali Karbassi. I am a working professional in the commerical industry working as a RF Engineer. I specialize in RF Test and Verification. 

I gradauted in 2021 with a degree in Wireless Embedded Systems from UC San Diego. Although I gained a lot of wealthy knowledge, I have not been able to apply the skills I acquired from the program since graduating so I have decided to come up with a personal project to refress and reinforce my wireless communicaiton and embedded systems knowledge that I gained in school.
